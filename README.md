   # Simple Data Exchanger (formally known Data Format Transformer)
---
## Description

This repository is part of the overarching Eclipse Tractus-X project. It contains the Backend for the SDE/DFT.
SDE Simple data exchanger(formally known DFT is short for Data Format Transformer)

It is a standalone service which can be self-hosted. 
It enables companies to provide their data in the Eclipse Tractus-X network via an EDC.

## Important !!!
### Deployment of SDE backend
The Auto-Setup is the central service orchestration component. The Auto-Setup hide all complex configuration properties for you and get SDE Backend as well as Frontend service deployed for you as service. The Auto-Setup taking all deployment through their specific helm charts. The Auto-Setup knows which prerequisites and which configurations are required for the components and creates them. All dependencies and any error messages are intercepted by Auto-Setup and treated correctly and meaningfully. Therefore, Auto-Setup meets your requirements exactly.

Once SDE deployed, The data is uploaded via CSV-files or tabular entry. The SDE registers the data in the Digital Twin Registry and makes it accessible via an EDC.

The SDE project has three dependencies: Digital Twins, Portal and EDC.

## How to run

For SDE installation, please refer the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file 

SDE is a SpringBoot Java Maven software project.

When running, the project requires a postgresql database to be available to connect.
You can find the standard require configuration keys as below:
